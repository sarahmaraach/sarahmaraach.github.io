	<p>A little bit about me: My name is Sarah and I'm a senior in high school. I love cats and Tae Kwon Do, but also, I like to challenge myself and try new things (which is why I'm taking this course in the first place). I am an active student at school, involved in many clubs. I also like to volunteer in my free time. My current volunteering job is coaching a youth basketball team.</p>
